The third project for the Data Science nano degree program of Udacity. 

"In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information
about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. Weâ€™ll look at relationships between
demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained."
